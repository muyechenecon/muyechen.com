<div><h3>Labor Market Effects of Environmental Disasters and Information Shocks: Evidence from Inland Oil Spills (Job Market Paper)</h3></div>
<div>This paper provides new and important causal estimates on how inland oil spills, one major type of environmental disasters, affect local labor markets. By exploiting severe inland petroleum oil spills and their news coverage status, I find spills negatively affect county-level labor markets, but only when a spill is in the news. In the five years after a news-covered severe inland spill, employment, wage, the number of establishments, and labor force all decrease significantly. Severe inland spills not reported in the news yield no such effects. Spill information induces composition changes in county-level gross out- and in-migration, weakening the labor market conditions in low-tradability industries, such as retail and food service. Information on environmental disasters triggers sorting, which results in distributional effects and degraded labor markets in counties that experienced news-covered spills. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, comparing to the control group, counties with news-covered spills lost 407K jobs, whose monetary value is equivalent to \$41.4B, and \$27.1B in foregone wages in aggregate in the entire post period.</div> <br>


<div><h3>No News is Bad News: Mortality Effects of Inland Oil Spills Vary with News Coverage</h3></div>
<div> Exploiting county-level variation in exposure to severe inland oil spills and their news coverage status, I estimate that oil spills raise ambient air pollution levels and mortality rates, but only when a spill is not reported in news. The rises in mortality rates are caused by the elevated level of air pollution and are concentrated in the most susceptible groups, children and the elderly. If a spill is covered in news, there are not only no changes in ambient air quality, but also persistent decreases in county-level mortality rates. By exploring heterogeneous effects, I show that the mortality rate decreases are due to out-migration. The findings imply that information on environmental disasters is beneficial to the environment and human health.</div>

<h2> Work in Progress </h2>
<div><h3>Local Multipliers of Green Jobs</h3></div>
<div> This paper evaluates the impacts of expanding green jobs on non-green employment, energy production and consumption, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. By employing a shift-share instrumental variable approach, I find that one additional green job generates 4.2 non-green jobs at the state level in the United States. Most of the increase comes from low-tradability industries. The cleaner an industry in terms of air pollution emissions, the larger the multiplier effect of green jobs. Furthermore, having more green jobs also significantly boosts the production and consumption of renewable energy, and lowers CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. </div>
