<div><h3>When Environmental Shocks are (not) Publicized: Labor Market Effects of Inland Oil Spills (Job Market Paper)</h3></div>
<div>This paper provides the first causal estimates on how inland oil spills, one major type of environmental disasters, affect local labor markets. By exploiting severe inland petroleum oil spills and their news coverage status, I find that oil spills negatively affect county-level labor markets only when a spill is in the news. In the five years after a news-covered severe inland spill, employment and wage, which are the equilibrium quantity and price, and the number of establishments and labor force, which act as imperfect measures of labor demand and supply, all decrease significantly. When a severe inland spill is not reported in the news, the county-level labor markets are intact. The mechanism behind the observed effects is that spill information induces composition changes in gross out- and in-migration, which weakens the labor market conditions in sectors of low tradability. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, comparing to the control group, counties with news-covered spills lost 515K jobs, whose monetary value is equivalent to \$55.1B, and \$30.3B in foregone wages in aggregate in the post period.</div> <br>


<div><h4>Mortality Effects of Pollution when Information is (not) Missing: Evidence from Inland Oil Spills</h4></div>
<div> Exploiting county-level variation in exposure to severe inland oil spills and their news coverage status, I estimate that oil spills raise ambient air pollution levels and mortality rates, but only when a spill is not reported in news. The rises in mortality rates are caused by the elevated level of air pollution and are concentrated in the most susceptible groups, children and the elderly. If a spill is covered in news, there are not only no changes in ambient air quality, but also persistent decreases in county-level mortality rates. By exploring heterogeneous effects, I show that the mortality rate decreases are due to out-migration. The findings imply that information on environmental disasters is beneficial to the environment and human health.</div> <br>
